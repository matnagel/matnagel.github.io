<p>We want to consider ways of understanding some aspects of Seiberg-Witten theory and the associated Floer theory in terms of stable homotopy theory. The general idea is to associate to the gauge theoretic situation a stable homotopy type. From this we can extract information by the plethora of invariants coming from algebraic topology such as homology. This new way of looking at things has been used to reprove gauge theoretic results like Donaldsonâ€™s diagonalisation, the 11/8 theorem and the triangulation conjecture.</p>
